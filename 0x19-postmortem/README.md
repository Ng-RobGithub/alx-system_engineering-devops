Definition:
A postmortem, also known as a post-incident review or retrospective, is a structured process conducted after a significant event or project to evaluate what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar issues in the future. In the context of software development, a postmortem is often performed after a system outage, a major bug discovery, or the completion of a project. Here's a detailed explanation of the postmortem process:

========================Postmortem: Outage Incident on Web Server===========================

ISSUE SUMMARY:

DURATION:
Start Time: February 25, 2024, 10:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: February 25, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)

IMPACT:
The web server hosting our e-commerce website experienced downtime during the outage.
Users were unable to access the website, resulting in a 100% outage for all users.

ROOT CAUSE:
The outage was caused by a sudden surge in traffic due to a marketing campaign, overwhelming the server's capacity and causing it to crash.

TIMELINE:

10:00 AM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating server response time degradation.
10:05 AM (UTC): Engineering team notified of the issue by monitoring system.
10:10 AM (UTC): Initial investigation focused on checking server logs for errors and analyzing network traffic.
10:20 AM (UTC): Assumption made that the issue may be related to a misconfiguration in the server settings.
10:30 AM (UTC): Additional investigation revealed no abnormal activities in the server logs or network traffic.
10:45 AM (UTC): Issue escalated to senior engineering team for further analysis.
11:00 AM (UTC): Root cause identified as server overload due to traffic spike from marketing campaign.
11:30 AM (UTC): Mitigation measures implemented, including scaling up server capacity and optimizing website code to handle increased traffic.
Root Cause and Resolution:

ROOT CAUSE:
The root cause of the outage was determined to be a sudden influx of traffic to the web server, exceeding its capacity and leading to server overload.
RESOLUTION:
The issue was resolved by scaling up the server capacity to handle the increased traffic load and implementing optimizations in the website code to improve performance and efficiency.

CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated scaling policies to dynamically adjust server capacity based on traffic patterns.
Optimize website code and database queries to improve performance and reduce server load.

TASK:
Set up automated monitoring alerts for traffic spikes and server performance metrics.
Conduct load testing to simulate high traffic scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks.
Document procedures for scaling server capacity and optimizing website code during traffic surges.
CONCLUSION:
The outage incident highlighted the need for proactive measures to handle unexpected traffic spikes and ensure the reliability and availability of our web services. By implementing automated monitoring, scaling, and optimization strategies, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and provide a seamless user experience for our customers.
